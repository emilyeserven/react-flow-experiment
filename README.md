# Todo

- ~~Make a custom node that fetches from swapi or pokemon api and allows someone to select something using a shadcn combobox~~
- Figure out... how do things get translated from the server (ie storage), to the UI/flow interface, then back to the server?
  - Figuring out DB is PITA so maybe just attempt save/load from localStorage for now
- Use pokemon node to figure out infinite scrolling in cmdk
  - Can also figure out how to load data after save (ex, load sprite for pokemon ([docs](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon)))
